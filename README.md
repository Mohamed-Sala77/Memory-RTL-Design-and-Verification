# Improved Memory RTL Design and Verification

## Key Improvements:

- **Clarity and Conciseness**: The design and verification processes are focused on essential details.
- **Technical Accuracy**: Ensures correct use of terminology and concepts.
- **Organization**: Logically structured into clear sections for ease of understanding.
- **Verification Depth**: Provides comprehensive verification coverage suggestions.

## Memory Characteristics:

- **Memory Size**: 16 words (32 bits each)

## RTL Implementation:

- **Language**: Verilog

## Verification Environments:

- **Languages/Tools**: SystemVerilog using UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)
- **Verification Approach**: Constrained randomization.
- **Functional Coverage**: Implemented using a subscriber class to track coverage metrics.

## Input/Output Ports:

- **Inputs**:
  - Data_in
  - Address
  - Enable
  - Clk
  - Rst
  - Read_Write
- **Outputs**:
  - Data_out
  - Valid_out

## Test Sequences:

1. **Basic Sequence**:
   - Reset -> Write (all addresses) -> Read (all addresses).
2. **Randomized Sequence**:
   - Sequential reset, read, and write operations with randomized transaction counts.
3. **Termination Criteria**:
   - End simulation after sequence completion or scoreboard verification.

## Additional Considerations:

### Functional Coverage (100% Target):
- Functional coverage tracking implemented via a subscriber class.
- Add coverage points for memory operations (read, write, address access).

### Performance Analysis:
- Evaluate memory access time and throughput.
- Use SystemVerilog assertions to track performance metrics.

### Code Coverage (90% Target).

### Corner Case Testing:
- Test boundary values (minimum/maximum addresses, data values).
- Include asynchronous reset scenarios and race condition testing.

### Error Handling:
- Validate memory behavior under invalid inputs (e.g., out-of-bounds addresses, write conflicts).
